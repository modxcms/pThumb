2.0.0-pl [09.09.2013]
----------------------

- Improve handling of paths, URLs and remote images
- [#2] Fix new_file_permissions setting
- Update Resizer to v0.3.1-pl
- Several minor bug fixes


2.0.0-rc3 [25.08.2013]
----------------------

- Update Resizer to v0.2.0-rc1, now a separate package
- [#1] Fix protocol-relative URLs for remote images
- Fix &useResizer and &debug properties
- Several minor speed and efficiency improvements


2.0.0-rc2 [12.08.2013]
--------------------

- Add Resizer v0.1, a light-weight modern alternative to phpThumb. Resizer is built
  on Imagine, supports the Gmagick, Imagick and GD extensions and is considerably
  faster than phpThumb for scaling/cropping operations. Plus all the ZC options now
  work with GD. Enable in System Settings. Requires PHP 5.3 or higher.
- Fix a PHP warning the phpThumbOfCacheManager plugin was throwing.



2.0.0-rc1
---------

- Major refactor for improved efficiency, especially when used multiple times on
  a page or when an image is already cached.
- Remove Amazon S3 support. I don't use or know much about this and rather than
  release completely untested and possibly broken code, I took it out.  If you'd
  like it added back and are interested in helping, please get in touch.
- Improve remote image handling. Originals are now downloaded to the cache to
  greatly speed up future access
- Improve debugging output, including easy access to the phpThumb debug messages
  created when a thumbnail is generated (new &debug property for phpThumbOf)


1.0.0-beta2
-----------

- Add resource id # to error log message to make finding problem images easier


1.0.0-beta1
-----------

- Initial Commit. Forked from phpThumbOf 1.4.0.
- Improve cache management and performance: the cache manager plugin has been changed
  to only clean the cache; it doesn't completely clear it.  Cache cleanup is only done
  on OnSiteRefresh events instead of every time phpThumbOf is run (which previously
  didn't work anyway), improving overall performance


phpThumbOf issues addressed:
- [#37] Add a phpthumbof.jpeg_quality global default JPEG quality setting
- [#41] Don't urldecode filenames
- [#46] add phpthumbof.check_mod_time option to refresh the cached image if the
  original has been modified
- [#44] [#49] Prevent generation of identical images when the same image is used in
  multiple resources
- [#48] [#49] Fix duplication of images with identical names in different directories
- [#47] Exit quickly and silently when called with no file name
- [#52] Make input file name handling more robust, particularly when MODX is
  install in a subdirectory
- [#53] Trim extension properly
- [#54] [#50] Fix cache cleaning
